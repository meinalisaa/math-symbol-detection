# math-symbol-detection
This web-based application utilizes the Faster R-CNN ResNet50 model trained with TensorFlow Object Detection API to perform object detection. It operates by performing inference from a Saved Model and can be accessed directly through a web browser using Flask as the server. The application identifies objects in images and provides predictions of symbols along with their corresponding bounding boxes.
